V1.1.0
heyo i actually updated Shigure. ; v ; he doesn't have much to say for now but hopefully he isn't as buggy as before. although i said that i will be holding off bug reports til V2, i think it's best if you could report any you see now that i've kinda gone through most of the code now. i am planning to redo Shigure's master shell since i was pretty inefficient with my layer usage and i'm planning to just do him better. since i am going to redo his shell, would that count as a V2.0.0...? that counts as a major update right? (at least visually < w <;;; ) at that point he will have more features and would have more surfaces (got a bunch of emotes planned out). that being said, i appreciate any support and bug reports for how he is now. you can report bugs in the Ukagaka Dream Team Discord server through #feedback_bug_requests and @ing me (@TechNekoKit). hope you enjoy hanging out with Shigure!

V1.0.1	
â€¢ added update path (that hopefully works... < w <;;; )



V1.0.0	5/18/23
hello and thank you for downloading my Ghost Jam 2023 Ghost, Shigure! :> this was made during my finals week so a lot of stuff was rushed. sorry for all the possible typos, bugs, and overall unfinished-ness... ; w ; normally i would ask you to DM me on my Tumblr about any bugs you may find but i'd like to hold off on that until i go over all the code again and work more on Shigure (maybe until ver. 2 :o )
